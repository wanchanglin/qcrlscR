Description: An R implementation of quality control–based robust LOESS(local
    polynomial regression fitting) signal correction for metabolomics data
    analysis, described in Dunn, W., Broadhurst, D., Begley, P. et al. (2011)
    <doi:10.1038/nprot.2011.335>. The optimisation of LOESS's span parameter
    using generalized cross-validation (GCV) is provided as an option. In
    addition to signal correction, 'qcrlscR' includes some utility functions
    like batch shifting and data filtering.
